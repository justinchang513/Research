This is the research under Professor Nicholas Gravish's Bio-inspired Robotics. The current version is the code required to move the bipedal robots. THe code right now is still under experimental phase; position vs current control. Position control is more absolute and gets the desired location in the most efficient way possible. However, this results in rigidity which could be problematic for obstacle-overcoming. With current control and virtual compliance, the body moves as if it's attached with virtual springs. Therefore, the mass has flexibility and has higher capability in obercoming obstacle.

This is the python version of the code. We are currently working the code but on Jupyter as its easier to adjust and execute immediate control updates. Moreover, we are trying to switch to Arduino/C++ so microcontrollers with significantly better Baud rates and communication may be used.
